# Challenge


Here is the first challenge of a ten days challenge in React.js. As I'm diving into React, I felt that I have to practice at the same time
to feel more comfortable with it.
This challenge was provided by [Chris on Code](https://scotch.io/@chris), you can found it here <https://scotch.io/courses/10-react-challenges-beginner/>
The first challenge is about Displaying data using JSX. Also there is a bonus challenge consisting of creating a reusable component for the user details. I finished the challenge with the bonus.

## How it works 

You can get a render of the result on this link https://codesandbox.io/s/github/amineMas/Challenge

You can also clone the project on your editor. Follow these steps :
1. Clone the project by using `git clone`
2. Open your terminal, move inside the project and run `npm install`. Wait until all packages are installed.
3. Then, in your terminal use `npm run start`. The browser will open and you'll see the user profil component
